# Anchor Placement Software for Area-based Localization

Code provided here allows the exploitation of Half Symmetric Lens (HSL)-based Area-based Localization. In addition to basic operations on HSL, there are implementations of a Brute Force (BF), Local Search Anchor Placement (LSAP), and GAAP (Genetic Algorithms Anchor Placement) algorithms designed in a paper submitted for publication.   

## 1) To run simulation:
```
$python selected_algorithm.py [parameters]
```

parameters are:

- selected_algorithm.py: brute_force.py, genetic.py, or heuristic.py

- max_x: side length of the service area.

- max_y: side length of the service area.

- points: the number points per side for the discretization.

- nb_anchors: the number of anchors.

- seed: seed value for random number generator.

- nb_ind: number of individuals in GAAP.

- nb_gen: number of generations in GAAP.

## 2) Files description:

our_library.py: core of area-based HSL algorithm.

heuristic.py: implementation of LSAP.

genetic.py: implementation of GAAP.

brute_force.py: implementation of BF.
